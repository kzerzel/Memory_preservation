    <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
    <p>As lives become busier and memories scatter across devices and platforms, it’s easy for precious moments to fade or disappear. We created the Memory Preservation Project to make it simple for anyone—parents, grandparents, couples, teachers, professionals—to capture, curate and protect their stories in one secure place. </p>
    <p>Our platform is built on a few core principles:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top:1rem; margin-left:1.5rem; list-style-type: disc;">
      <li><strong>Longevity</strong>: We offer storage designed to outlast hardware cycles and software trends, with redundant backup and options for multi‑generational archiving.</li>
      <li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: Memories should sound and feel like you. Record audio, video and written reflections in your own voice and style, and decide who can access them and when.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical AI</strong>: Advanced features like voice clones or chatbots are opt‑in, trained only on the data you provide. We never harvest social‑media content without consent and we’re transparent about AI limitations.</li>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: Whether you’re a parent documenting a child’s milestones or a historian preserving a community’s oral traditions, our tools adapt to your narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect</strong>: Grief is personal. We build tools that honour life without exploiting loss. We encourage healthy remembrance and provide guidelines to support emotional well‑being.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Getting started is easy. Create an account and begin recording stories using our guided prompts or upload videos and photos from your archives. Organize your memories into collections—by year, person, theme or event. Share specific collections with loved ones, keep them private, or schedule them to be released on a future date.</p>
    <p>Our AI features (optional) enable you to create digital avatars or story companions. These use your recordings to answer questions and tell stories in your voice. You always maintain full control over your data and can delete it at any time.</p>
    <p>Under the hood, we employ industry‑standard encryption, redundant storage across multiple data centres and compliance with international privacy regulations. We’re committed to keeping your memories safe for the long term.</p>
